#### CRM Data Sync and Tagging Protocol - EddieBoscanaAiSalesEngine

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines procedures for automating CRM data syncing, tagging, and segmentation to organize and prioritize leads based on their engagement level and behavior. The objective is to maintain accurate and up-to-date lead information in GoHighLevel, ensuring seamless transitions between AI-driven engagement and manual follow-up.

#### 1. Data Syncing and Automation Setup

**A. CRM Data Syncing with GoHighLevel**  
   - **Objective**: Ensure real-time updates of lead data in GoHighLevel after every interaction to maintain accuracy and support personalized follow-ups.
   - **Process**:
     - Configure automatic syncing for new lead data and interaction updates.
     - Enable two-way sync between GoHighLevel and other engagement platforms, ensuring that updates reflect on both ends.
     - Sync engagement data such as last interaction date, engagement level, and follow-up requirements.

**B. Automated Lead Segmentation and Tagging**  
   - **Objective**: Automatically categorize and tag leads based on their behavior, engagement level, and interaction history.
   - **Tagging Categories**:
     - **Interested**: Leads expressing positive engagement or booking interest. 
     - **Cold**: Leads with minimal engagement or inactive for over 30 days, added to a periodic re-engagement sequence.
     - **Warm**: Engaged leads showing signs of interest but not yet booking-ready.
     - **Booked**: Leads who have scheduled a meeting or demo with Eddie.

**C. Priority Alerting for High-Value Leads**  
   - **Purpose**: Notify Eddie immediately when a high-value lead interacts or expresses immediate interest in a demo or consultation.
   - **Process**:
     - Configure GoHighLevel to trigger alerts for leads tagged as “high-value” or “ready-to-book.”
     - Route notifications directly to Eddie for timely follow-up with these prioritized leads.

#### 2. Dynamic Tagging Logic and Trigger-Based Updates

**A. Engagement Level Updates**  
   - **Objective**: Adjust lead tags dynamically based on interaction quality and engagement signals.
   - **Trigger-Based Logic**:
     - **Interested → Warm**: If a lead responds positively but does not book, tag as “Warm.”
     - **Warm → Booked**: Tag updated to “Booked” once the lead schedules a demo or consultation.
     - **Interested → Cold**: Move to “Cold” if no response after 2-3 follow-up messages within a month.

**B. Re-Engagement Sequence for Dormant Leads**  
   - **Tagging Process**:
     - Leads tagged as “Cold” are automatically added to a re-engagement list.
     - Trigger an SMS re-engagement campaign for dormant leads every 45 days.

#### 3. Data Accuracy and Monthly Tag Review

**A. Regular Data Accuracy Checks**  
   - **Frequency**: Perform data checks monthly to ensure all leads are accurately tagged and engagement levels reflect current interaction status.
   - **Process**:
     - Verify that tags align with the latest lead activities.
     - Correct any tagging discrepancies (e.g., leads still tagged as “Warm” but unresponsive for over a month).

**B. Metrics for Tagging Efficiency**  
   - **Tagging Accuracy**: Target >95% accuracy for all engagement-based tags (Interested, Cold, Warm, Booked).
   - **Lead Status Changes**: Track changes in lead status over time to measure the effectiveness of re-engagement efforts and follow-up success.
