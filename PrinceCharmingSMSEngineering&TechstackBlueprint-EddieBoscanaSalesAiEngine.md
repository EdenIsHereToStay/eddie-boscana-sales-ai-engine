#### 2. Re-engagement Flow and Messaging Strategy

**A. Initial Introduction Sequence**  
   - **Objective**: Use a friendly, introductory message to re-establish contact with dormant leads.
   - **Message Template**:  
     - “Hi! This is Sarah, Eddie Boscana’s digital assistant. Eddie asked me to reach out because he thought you might be interested in some recent updates that could be valuable for your team. Would you be open to a quick chat?”

**B. Qualifying Questions**  
   - **Purpose**: Gather relevant information about the lead’s current needs and interest level.
   - **Example Qualifying Question**:  
     - “Can you tell me a bit about your team’s sales engagement goals? This way, I can make sure our conversation is as relevant as possible to your needs.”

**C. Demo and Meeting Prompt**  
   - **Purpose**: Encourage leads to transition from initial interest to an interactive demo or one-on-one meeting with Eddie.
   - **Message Template**:  
     - “It sounds like our solutions could really support your goals! Would you be interested in a quick demo to see what’s possible? Eddie would love to walk you through it personally.”

#### 3. Success Metrics and Feedback

**A. Engagement Rate Tracking**  
   - **Metric**: Measure the percentage of re-engaged leads responding within 48 hours of the initial message.
   - **Goal**: Achieve a 50% engagement rate on the first message.

**B. Conversion Rate to Demo or Meeting**  
   - **Metric**: Track the conversion rate from SMS re-engagement to booked demos or meetings.
   - **Goal**: Target a 25% conversion from initial SMS engagement to scheduled consultations.

**C. Feedback Collection**  
   - After each demo or booked meeting, request feedback from the lead on message quality, relevance, and response timing.
   - Use insights to adjust messaging, timing, and frequency for ongoing improvement.

#### 4. Automation and Workflow Adjustments

**A. Conditional Follow-Up Messages**  
   - **Setup**: Based on lead responses, set up a sequence for automatic follow-ups:
     - **If No Response**: Send a friendly reminder 2 days after the initial message.
     - **If Interested but Not Ready**: Schedule a check-in 1 week later to gauge interest.
     - **If Interested and Ready**: Immediately offer a booking link or schedule a demo.

**B. CRM Tagging and Data Syncing**  
   - **Tagging System**: Auto-apply tags based on engagement:
     - “Interested” for engaged leads, “Cold” for unresponsive leads.
   - **Data Syncing**: Update the CRM with engagement levels, interests, and scheduled meetings, ensuring data remains accurate for future interactions.
