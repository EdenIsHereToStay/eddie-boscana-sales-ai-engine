#### 1. Client Lifecycle Stages and AI-Driven Objectives

**A. Initial Contact and Qualification**  
   - **Objective**: Establish a warm, professional connection and gather initial insights into the client’s needs.
   - **Process**:
     - Use AI to send an introductory message immediately after a lead enters the system, introducing the assistant as Eddie’s digital counterpart.
     - Include qualifying questions based on industry and lead type to capture basic information and gauge interest.
   - **Example Message**:  
     - “Hi! This is Sarah, Eddie’s digital assistant. Eddie thought you might be interested in learning more about our AI solutions. Can you tell me a bit about your current goals?”

**B. Engagement and Demo Presentation**  
   - **Objective**: Provide an interactive demo to highlight the AI’s relevance and potential benefits for the client’s specific goals.
   - **Process**:
     - Transition interested leads from initial contact to a tailored demo based on their responses to qualifying questions.
     - Use CRM data to customize the demo, integrating industry-specific terminology and addressing known challenges.
   - **Example Message**:  
     - “Based on what you’ve shared, we’ve put together a quick demo to show you exactly how our solutions can fit your needs. Let’s dive in!”

#### 2. Scheduling and Follow-Up

**A. Consultation and Demo Scheduling**  
   - **Objective**: Prompt the lead to book a one-on-one consultation with Eddie after the demo, reinforcing the value of a personalized session.
   - **Process**:
     - After the demo, offer a scheduling link through GoHighLevel or manually book based on lead availability.
     - Set automated reminders for the lead prior to the scheduled consultation.
   - **Example Message**:  
     - “Eddie would love to discuss your goals in more detail. Would you like to schedule a one-on-one to explore how we can help?”

**B. Post-Demo Follow-Up**  
   - **Objective**: Maintain engagement with leads who may need more time to decide or explore further options.
   - **Process**:
     - Send follow-up messages within 24-48 hours of the demo, offering additional resources or a recap of the demo highlights.
     - If there’s no response, schedule periodic check-ins every 1-2 weeks.
   - **Example Message**:  
     - “Just following up from our demo! Let me know if you’d like any additional information, or if you’re ready to chat with Eddie one-on-one.”

#### 3. Post-Consultation Engagement

**A. Decision Support and Re-engagement**  
   - **Objective**: Provide relevant information to assist clients in the decision-making process, helping them feel confident in proceeding with Eddie’s solutions.
   - **Process**:
     - Send tailored information that highlights how Eddie’s services align with their goals.
     - Offer a re-engagement sequence for leads who go cold post-consultation.
   - **Example Re-engagement Message**:  
     - “Hi again! Just wanted to check in and see if you had any questions about our conversation or how we could support your team.”

**B. CRM Tagging and Status Updates**  
   - **Objective**: Use CRM tagging to track each lead’s progress through the lifecycle and ensure timely follow-ups based on their stage.
   - **Process**:
     - Tag clients as “Qualified,” “Demoed,” “Consulted,” or “Post-Consultation” to manage follow-ups appropriately.
     - Update tags dynamically based on lead interactions and responses.

**A. Engagement Conversion Rates**  
   - Track the conversion rate from initial contact to demo scheduling, and from demo to consultation.
   - Target: 60% of qualified leads proceed to demo; 40% of demoed leads proceed to consultation.

**B. Follow-Up Efficiency**  
   - Measure response rates to follow-up messages post-demo and post-consultation.
   - Target: Achieve a 50% response rate to post-demo follow-ups and a 30% response rate to post-consultation re-engagements.

**C. Client Satisfaction and Feedback**
