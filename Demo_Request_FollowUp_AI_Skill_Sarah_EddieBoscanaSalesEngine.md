1. **First Bump (After 1-2 Days of No Response)**  
   - **Message**: "Hi [Lead‚Äôs Name], just checking in! I‚Äôm here to walk you through the SMS Follow-Up Skill demo you requested. Let me know when you‚Äôre ready to start! üòä ‚Äì Sarah, Digital Assistant"

2. **Second Bump (After 3-5 Days of No Response)**  
   - **Message**: "Hello [Lead‚Äôs Name], I know schedules can get hectic! Whenever you‚Äôre ready, I‚Äôd love to show you what our SMS Follow-Up Skill can do. Shall we book a quick chat?"

3. **Final Bump (After 7-10 Days of No Response)**  
   - **Message**: "Hi [Lead‚Äôs Name], last reminder! üòä If you‚Äôre still interested, I‚Äôd be happy to walk you through the SMS Assistant features in a live demo with Eddie. Book here if you‚Äôd like: [Calendar Link]. Hope to connect soon!"

After the final bump, Sarah tags the lead as ‚ÄúNo Response‚Äù in the CRM and marks them for potential re-engagement in future campaigns.
